##### PWA  - Progressive Web Applications

##### Code splitting
The very difficulty faced when developing enterprise application is code splitting. We don't need everything in a single JS file. Why not create individual JS files for each respective module/page!
We make it really easy here to just create a page that returns an array of routes. Code is split and loaded automatically when the respective route is called.
